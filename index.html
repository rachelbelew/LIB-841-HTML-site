    <h2 style="color: darkgreen;">About This Website</h2>

    <p>
        Hello and welcome! My name is <strong>Rachel Belew</strong>. I am currently pursuing my <em>Rank I in Library Science</em>.
        This website is designed to document my journey, interests, and professional growth in the field of educational technology and librarianship.
    </p>

    <p>
        Throughout this website, you’ll find samples of my work, reflections on what I’m learning, and resources I find 
        <b style="color: magenta;">valuable</b> for both current and future librarians. 
        <br><br>
        During this program, I have found a passion for integrating technology into library spaces to support student learning and engagement.

    <p>
        My short-term goal is to complete my Rank I and begin working in a school library where I can 
        <strong>inspire young readers</strong> and support teachers.
        Long-term, I hope to contribute to curriculum development and digital literacy efforts within my district.
